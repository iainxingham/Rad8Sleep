## Data loading and cleaning

Keep data out of the git repo - exclude `./Data` in the `.gitignore`.

Cleaning

- read.csv("./Data/file.csv")
  - Doesn't work as not all columns have header
- Skip the column headers
- Convert first column to lubridate dates
  - Drop any rows without a valid date to get rid of a few rows with no valid data
- Some rows seem to have the column label incorporated eg "SpO2=000".
